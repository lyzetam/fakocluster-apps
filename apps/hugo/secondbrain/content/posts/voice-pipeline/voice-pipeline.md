## ðŸŽ¤ Voice-Controlled Home Automation

### Overview
This implementation demonstrates a complete voice assistant pipeline using Wyoming Satellite with Home Assistant, achieving a successful voice interaction where a user queries smart home status and receives an AI-generated response in 17 seconds.

### Components Used
- **OpenWakeWord**: Wake word detection ("Hey Jarvis")
- **Whisper**: Speech-to-text transcription
- **Ollama (Llama 8B)**: Natural language understanding and response generation
- **Piper TTS**: Text-to-speech synthesis
- **Home Assistant**: Smart home orchestration and pipeline management
- **Wyoming Satellite**: Voice satellite software on Raspberry Pi

### Hardware Setup
- **Raspberry Pi 5** (2.4GHz, 4GB RAM) - Voice satellite device
- **ME6S USB Microphone** - Audio input device
- **Bluetooth Speaker** (88:92:CC:5D:CB:79) - Audio output via BlueALSA
- **Mini PC** - Home Assistant server
- **Kubernetes Cluster** - Container orchestration for AI services

### Implementation

#### Example Interaction
**User Query:** "Any lights on in the master bathroom?"  
**System Response:** "Based on the live context, there are no lights currently on in the master bathroom. The Master Bathroom Lights are off."  
**Total Time:** 17 seconds

#### Pipeline Stages

![Voice Pipeline Flow](images/voice-pipeline-flow.png)
*Figure 2: Complete voice pipeline flow from wake word to response*

**1. Wake Word Detection (0-1 second)**
- Microphone continuously captures audio at 16kHz
- Audio streams to Wyoming Satellite service
- Satellite forwards to OpenWakeWord pod (K8s NodePort 30400)
- Detection confirmed for "hey_jarvis" with confidence threshold

**2. Speech Recognition (1-4 seconds)**
- User speech captured and streamed to Home Assistant
- Audio forwarded to Whisper STT pod (NodePort 30300)
- Real-time transcription returns: "any lights on in the master bathroom"

**3. Intent Processing & AI Response (4-7 seconds)**
- Home Assistant identifies intent: query light status
- State query retrieves: `light.master_bathroom_lights` (state: off)
- Context sent to Ollama pod running Llama 8B
- LLM generates natural response with current state information

**4. Text-to-Speech Synthesis (7-9 seconds)**
- Response text sent to Piper TTS pod (NodePort 30200)
- Speech synthesized using 'en_US-ryan-high' voice model
- Audio generated at 22050Hz sample rate

**5. Audio Playback (9-17 seconds)**
- Audio streamed back through Wyoming Satellite
- BlueALSA manages Bluetooth A2DP protocol
- Real-time playback through Bluetooth speaker

#### Performance Metrics
| Stage | Duration | Percentage |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Wake Word Detection | 1s | 6% |
| Speech Recognition | 4s | 24% |
| AI Processing | 3s | 18% |
| TTS Generation | 2s | 12% |
| Audio Playback | 8s | 47% |
| **Total Pipeline** | **17s** | **100%** |

#### Key Optimizations
- **CPU Governor:** Performance mode (2.4GHz constant)
- **WiFi Power Save:** Disabled for consistent latency
- **Network Timeouts:** Increased to 30s (handles 700ms spikes)
- **Audio Buffers:** 4096 frames for smooth playback

#### Network Configuration
```python
_PONG_TIMEOUT: Final = 30  # Increased from 5
_PING_SEND_DELAY: Final = 5  # Increased from 2
_WAKE_INFO_TIMEOUT: Final = 10  # Increased from 2
```

#### Success Indicators
âœ… Reliable "Hey Jarvis" detection  
âœ… Accurate speech-to-text conversion  
âœ… Correct intent extraction  
âœ… Natural, contextual AI responses  
âœ… Clear TTS playback via Bluetooth  
âœ… No disconnections despite 37% packet loss  
âœ… 17-second end-to-end response time

### Key Achievement
Despite operating over WiFi with significant latency variations (38-700ms) and packet loss (37%), the system maintains stability through optimized timeouts and performance tuning, delivering a reliable voice assistant experience capable of understanding context, querying smart home devices, and generating natural language responses.
