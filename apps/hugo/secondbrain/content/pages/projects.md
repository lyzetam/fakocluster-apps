# The Fako Cluster: A Production-Gradish HomeLab

*How I built a production-gradish Kubernetes homelab that connects learning and real-world engineering*

## The Story Behind This Project

As a mechanical engineer, I've always been fascinated by how things work under the hood. Just as I used to design complex mechanical systems and rebuild engines with my dad during the summers, I wanted to deconstruct modern cloud infrastructure and rebuild it from scratch, within my 4 walls. Those summer days taught me that understanding comes from getting your hands dirty – whether it's adjusting valve clearances or configuring Kubernetes operators. The Fako Cluster is that same journey in the digital realm – a homelab that doesn't just run applications, but tries to implement how enterprise-grade systems are designed, secured, and operated.
What does this mean?
1. If it's not in Git, it doesn't exist
2. If its not declarative then its not happening
3. Defense in depth with pragmatic choices
4. Native and Open source first approach
5. Small pieces, loosely coupled (mono repo with layers)
6. Data should outlive containers
7. You can't fix what you can't see
8. Understand by building, improve by iterating
9. Automate everything that happens twice
10. Complexity is the enemy of reliability

## The Application Ecosystem

### 🤖 AI/ML Stack: Privacy-First Intelligence

Running LLMs locally isn't just about avoiding API costs – it's about data sovereignty:

- **Ollama**: GPU-accelerated inference server running models like Llama 3 and Mistral on RTX 5070
- **OpenWebUI + GPUStack**: Beautiful interface powered by a distributed macOS cluster for family-wide AI access
- **MLX Distributed Inference**: Leveraging Apple Silicon for efficient model serving ([see the implementation →](https://github.com/lyzetam/mlx-distributed-inference))

**GPU Assignment Strategy**: The yeezyai node's dual GPUs are strategically allocated:
- **RTX 5070 (12GB GDDR7)**: Runs large language models with DLSS 4 and ray tracing capabilities
- **RTX 3050**: Dedicated to Whisper for speech-to-text processing
- Deployments use node affinity and GPU device selection for optimal resource utilization

### 🏠 The Alexa Replacement: Voice-First Smart Home

I built a complete voice assistant that respects privacy and runs entirely on-premises:

- **Home Assistant**: Running on Raspberry Pi, the brain of my smart home
- **Voice Preview Edition**: Captures voice input throughout the house
- **YeezyAI Processing**: The GPU node handles:
  - **Whisper**: Speech-to-text conversion
  - **LLM Integration**: Natural language understanding
  - **Piper**: Text-to-speech for responses
- **Result**: Full voice control of my home + AI conversations, zero cloud dependency

This isn't just about privacy – it's about ownership. My family's conversations stay in our home, processed by our hardware, under our control.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family AI: Governance at Home

The distributed AI infrastructure serves my entire family with proper governance:

- **GPUStack Backend**: macOS nodes clustered together for distributed inference
- **Multi-User Access**: Each family member has their own AI assistant access
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track and understand AI usage patterns
- **Content Filtering**: Age-appropriate responses for younger family members
- **Data Sovereignty**: All conversations, queries, and responses stay within our network

This demonstrates enterprise AI governance principles applied at home scale – proving that responsible AI doesn't require cloud providers.

### 🏥 Health & Fitness: Data-Driven Wellness

The Oura integration showcases full-stack development:
- **Collector Service**: Smart backfill logic that only fetches new data
- **PostgreSQL Storage**: Time-series optimized schema
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of sleep, activity, and readiness

[Check out the application code here →](https://github.com/lyzetam/fakocluster-apps)

### 🔐 Security: Enterprise Patterns at Home

- **Keycloak**: Full OIDC provider with HA deployment
- **OAuth2 Proxy**: Every app protected by SSO
- **Gitleaks**: Automated secret scanning with remediation
- **Network Policies**: Zero-trust networking between pods

## Infrastructure Components

### External Secrets Operator

Manages all sensitive data through AWS Secrets Manager:
- Database credentials
- API keys
- OAuth secrets
- Internal service endpoints

**Pattern**: Each namespace has its own SecretStore with scoped AWS IAM permissions

### CloudNative-PG

Production-grade PostgreSQL:
- 3-node HA cluster
- Automated backups to NFS
- Point-in-time recovery
- Connection pooling with PgBouncer
- Monitoring integration

## Security & Secret Management

### Zero-Trust Secrets

No sensitive data in Git repository:

1. **AWS Secrets Manager**: Central secret storage
2. **External Secrets Operator**: Syncs secrets to Kubernetes
3. **SOPS Encryption**: AWS credentials encrypted in Git
4. **Dynamic Configuration**: IPs and endpoints from secrets

### Network Security
- **Ingress**: Traefik with automatic TLS
- **External Access**: Cloudflare tunnels for select services
- **Internal**: Network policies for pod-to-pod communication
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 proxy with Keycloak

### Cloudflare Integration

Cloudflare provides secure external access without exposing my home IP:

- **Cloudflare Tunnels**: Zero-trust connectivity to internal services
  - No port forwarding required
  - DDoS protection built-in
  - Encrypted tunnel from cluster to Cloudflare edge
- **Services Exposed**:
  - Keycloak (auth.landryzetam.net)
  - Oura Dashboard (oura-health.landryzetam.net)
  - OpenWebUI (ai.landryzetam.net)
  - Selected applications based on need
- **Security Benefits**:
  - Hide home IP address
  - Cloudflare's WAF and bot protection
  - Access policies and authentication rules
  - SSL/TLS termination at edge

## Monitoring & Observability

### Beyond Basic Metrics

Most homelabs have Grafana. Mine has:

- **Custom Dashboards**: GPU utilization, voice pipeline latency, backup status
- **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration for request flow analysis
- **Log Aggregation**: Every log searchable, correlated with metrics
- **Proactive Alerts**: Know about issues before they impact services

### The 3 AM Test

Can I diagnose and fix issues at 3 AM when I'm half asleep? The monitoring stack ensures:
- Clear error messages in logs
- Runbook links in alerts
- One-click rollback via Flux
- Automated recovery where possible

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites (The Honest Version)

- **Hardware**: At least 3 nodes (VMs work too!)
- **Patience**: This isn't a weekend project
- **Curiosity**: You'll learn Kubernetes, GitOps, and about 20 other technologies
- **Coffee**: Lots of it


## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Brilliantly

1. **External Secrets Operator**: Game-changer for secret management
2. **Flux's Kustomization Controller**: Perfect balance of flexibility and structure
3. **CloudNative-PG**: Production-grade PostgreSQL that "just works"
4. **GPU Operator**: Simplified what could have been driver hell
5. **Dynamic NFS Configuration**: No more hardcoded IPs!

### What I'd Do Differently

1. Start with observability from day one (added it later, wished I hadn't)
2. Use Flux's multi-tenancy features earlier
3. Implement network policies from the start
4. Document as I go (hence this README!)
5. Set up automated testing for manifests

### The Human Side of Engineering

This cluster isn't just about running services – it's about understanding the entire stack. When I deploy an application, I know:
- How the container runtime works
- How service discovery happens
- How storage is provisioned
- How secrets are managed
- How traffic flows through the system

## The Future

### Immediate Roadmap

- **Service Mesh**: Exploring Linkerd for advanced traffic management
- **Backup to S3**: Extending backups beyond local NFS
- **Multi-Cluster**: Federation across multiple physical locations
- **Edge ML**: Deploying models to edge devices

### The Bigger Picture

This cluster is a living laboratory. It's where I test ideas before implementing them in production environments. It's where I learn new technologies in a safe space. Most importantly, it's where I can push boundaries without worrying about breaking someone else's infrastructure.

## Final Thoughts

Building this cluster taught me more about modern infrastructure than any course or certification could. It forced me to understand not just the "how" but the "why" behind every architectural decision.

To future employers: This is how I approach systems engineering. I don't just deploy applications – I build platforms. I don't just solve today's problems – I architect for tomorrow's challenges. And I document everything because the best code is the code that others can understand and improve.

To fellow engineers: Your homelab doesn't have to be perfect. Start small, fail fast, and iterate. The journey is more valuable than the destination.

*"In the end, we are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master."* – Ernest Hemingway

That's the beauty of systems engineering – there's always more to learn, always ways to improve, and always new problems to solve.

**Happy clustering!** 🚀
